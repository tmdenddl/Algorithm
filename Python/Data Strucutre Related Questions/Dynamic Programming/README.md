## Dynamic Programming

### What is Dynamic Programming?
It is a technique for solving problems. Dynamic Programming focuses on diving a probelm into sub-problems. Results from the sub-problems are saved and used later to derive the actual answer for the original problem.

Basically we're saving the solutions of the sub-problems, so we don't repeat redundant calculations. Here we're trading a memory for a speed.

### How to know if a problem is a DP problem?
1. Problem is recursive
2. A lot of repeated states in the solution

### Approaches
There are two approaches to solving DP problem:
1. Top-down
2. Buttom-up
